# Webdriver Demo

This repo is a quick sketch to demonstrate a few things we have discussed adding
to our testing approach:

1. Running aXe accessibility checks against all themes.
2. Checking the contrast of clickable items against their background.
3. Confirming that our sound support (provided by Tone.js) works in an actual browser.

To run the tests in this suite, use the command `npm test`.  This runs the wdio
client using the configuration file in this package.
